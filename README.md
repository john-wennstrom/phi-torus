# phi-torus
An array of torus that expands to infinity to the `n:th` torus.

Every torus `n` has:

* ODia to IDia ratio is `Phi^(2n - 1)`
* Surface mapping dimension follows `36 x 9( L(2n + 1) )`, where 
L is the numbers from the [Lucas sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_sequence)
* Total points: `Surface mapping * 2`
